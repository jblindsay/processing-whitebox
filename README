Whitebox for Processing
---------------------------
WhiteboxTools is an advanced geospatial data analysis engine developed
at the University of Guelph's Geomorphometry and Hydrogeomatics Research
Group. It is intended to provide a platform for advanced geospatial data
analysis with applications in both environmental research and the
geomatics industry. Also it was envisioned from the outset as providing
an ideal platform for experimenting with novel geospatial analysis methods.

Processing is a geoprocessing environment that can be used to call native
and third party algorithms from QGIS, making your spatial analysis tasks
more productive and easy to accomplish.

This plugin implements Whitebox provider for QGIS Processing framework.
Plugin requires QGIS >= 3.0
